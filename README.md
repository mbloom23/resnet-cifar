# resnet-cifar

This project contains a custom implementation of a 20-layer residual convolutional neural network (ResNet-20). The model architecture, data augmentation, and training/validation algorithm are contained in the `resnet20-cifar10` notebook, while the `save_test_predictions` notebook generates test predictions on the data from the kaggle competition hosted [here](https://www.kaggle.com/t/a6201262c9884fe3870dec7760576577). The model as implemented here achieves over 90% accuracy on the test data.
